[b]Old Gods - Music v1.2[/b]
Old Gods is intended to be a series of mods to make Rimworld a bit darker. 

[h1]Description[/h1]
	Old Gods - Music adds a selection of Kevin MacLeod song clips designed to create an eerie forboding atmosphere. It does not remove or preclude other music from playing while in a map.  It does replace the main menu music and the short clip that plays when starting a new colony.  

[h1]Conflicts[/h1]
	If another mod replaces the main menu song or the Game Start Sting, whichever is lower in the load order will play.
